# Moonshot Project

The aim of this project is to improve the screen readers that already exist, because currently when you have an image, screen readers only read the text written in the "alt" part of a website. My project is to enable all screen readers to read a whole text without the alt part, because many websites don't have an alt part and screen readers can't read the text of these images.
