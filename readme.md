# Moonshot Project

The aim of this project is to improve the screen readers that already exist, because currently when you have an image, screen readers only read the text written in the "alt" tag of a website. Sometimes the "alt" tag is not here. So the screen reader will not be able to read the image. The goal of this project is to create an extension that will generate the correct alternative text for an image. The extension will take an image as input, use a machine learning model to recognize the content of the image, and generate the correct alternative text for the image.
