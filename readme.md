# Moonshot Project

The aim of this project is to improve the screen readers that already exist, because currently when you have an image, screen readers only read the text written in the "alt" tag of a website. My project is to enable all screen readers to read a whole text without the alt tag, because many websites don't have an alt tag and screen readers can't read the text of these images. For that, the extension will generate alt tags for images that don't have them.
