# Advancement of the third idea during March

At the beginning I have send an email to Jihane because she can help me to know exactly what a blind person want and how they use a computer with the existing software. Her answer was "I can't tell you for sure that the tool doesn't exist. I think the best for him would be something a bit like Siri or Alexa. He could ask to read his email, ask to dictate answers, check the news, but in a conversational style." I have check the existing software related to that. The problem is it's already exist a lot of software who manage this part. The real problem with existing softwares is the set up of them. After I find a website named **facil-iti**. So I have send an email to the company to know more about them and why their extension is not compatible with a lot of website like the social media or the news because the website like Facebook,Instagram or Twitter are not compatible, it's the same for french news for example and it's really important the news for everyone. For the moment they don't answer me but I hope they will answer me soon. After that I have try the existing software like **facil-iti** it's really useful but it's the same problem of set up the software. It's for that I have send the software to Jihane because she is really interest about the topic of the moonshot project. It's for that I wait also her feedback about the extension of **facil-iti** to know how effective the software is.
