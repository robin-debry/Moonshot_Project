## Introduction

This document outlines the technical specifications for a project aimed at improving screen readers by generating accurate alternative text for images using a machine learning model. This will enhance web accessibility for people with visual impairments.

## Context

Screen readers help visually impaired users navigate the web by reading aloud the text content of web pages. However, they often struggle with images that lack descriptive alternative text. This project seeks to address this issue by developing a browser extension that uses machine learning to automatically generate appropriate alt text for images, thus improving web accessibility.

## Target audience

The primary users of this project are:

**Visually impaired individuals:** People who rely on screen readers to access web content.

## Technologies

The project will utilize the following technologies:

**Programming Languages:** Python for developing and training the machine learning model, JavaScript for developing the browser extension, and HTML/CSS for the user interface.
Frameworks: PyTorch and Ultralytics YOLOv8 for machine learning, Flask for the server backend.

**Tools:**

- IDEs: Visual Studio Code
- Version Control: Git and GitHub
- Virtual Environment: Virtualenv for managing Python dependencies
- Software Architecture: The software architecture of this project follows a modular and scalable design, consisting of the following components:

### Browser Extension (Frontend)

**Responsibilities:**

- Capture images from web pages.
- Send images to the backend server for processing.
- Display generated alternative text to the user.

**Technologies:**

- JavaScript for the core functionality.
- HTML/CSS for the user interface.

### Backend Server

**Responsibilities:**

- Host the machine learning model.
- Receive image data from the browser extension.
- Process images using the machine learning model to generate alt text.
- Send the generated alt text back to the browser extension.

**Technologies:**

- Flask for setting up a lightweight server.
- PyTorch and Ultralytics YOLOv8 for integrating and serving the machine learning model.

### Machine Learning Model

**Responsibilities:**

- Recognize the content of images.
- Generate descriptive alt text.

**Technologies:**

- PyTorch for the underlying deep learning framework.
- Ultralytics YOLOv8 for object detection and feature extraction.

## Setting up Python environment

Create a virtual environment using virtualenv to ensure a clean and isolated environment for the project. Run the following command in the project directory:

1. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    virtualenv venv
    ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install flask torch torchvision ultralytics
    ```

4. Install the Comet_ml package for tracking and optimizing the model:

    ```bash
    pip install comet_ml
    ```

    This package is optional but recommended for better tracking and optimizing of the model.

## Integrating the extension with the browser

- Packaging the browser extension for different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
- Ensuring compatibility with various screen readers (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver).

## Why Ultralytics YOLOv8 is the best choice for this project

### Pertinence Against the Problem

- The problem of generating descriptive alt text for images is essentially an image captioning task, which requires understanding and describing the content of an image in natural language.
  
- YOLOv8 is a state-of-the-art object detection system that can detect and classify multiple objects within an image, providing detailed information about the content. This makes it ideal for generating descriptive alt text for images.

- Feature Extraction and Caption Generation: YOLOv8 can detect and classify multiple objects within an image, providing detailed information about the content. These features can then be used to generate descriptive and contextually relevant alt text, ensuring that visually impaired users receive accurate descriptions of the visual content.

- This choice of algorithm leverages the strengths of YOLOv8 in real-time object detection to provide a robust solution for generating alt text, directly addressing the needs of visually impaired users who rely on screen readers.

## Comparison of YOLOv8 with Other Models

### YOLOv8

**Strengths:**

- Real-time Performance: YOLOv8 is designed for real-time object detection, providing quick and accurate detection of multiple objects in an image.
High Accuracy: It offers improved accuracy and speed compared to earlier YOLO versions.
- Versatility: Effective in detecting a wide variety of objects, making it useful for generating descriptive alt text in diverse contexts.

**Weaknesses:**

- Caption Generation: YOLOv8 focuses on object detection. Additional steps are needed to convert detected objects into descriptive sentences.
  
### VGG16 + LSTM

**Strengths:**

- Image Captioning: Combining VGG16 (a CNN) with LSTM (a type of RNN) is a classic approach for image captioning. VGG16 extracts features, and LSTM generates coherent captions.
- Proven Performance: This architecture has been widely used and validated for generating descriptive captions.

**Weaknesses:**

- Speed: Slower compared to YOLOv8 in terms of object detection due to the complexity of combining CNN and LSTM.
- Scalability: May not perform as well in real-time applications compared to YOLOv8.

### ResNet + Transformer

**Strengths:**

- High Accuracy: Known for excellent performance in generating high-quality captions.

**Weaknesses:**

- Complexity: More computationally intensive and requires more resources, which can impact real-time performance.
- Implementation Difficulty: More complex to implement and fine-tune compared to YOLOv8.

### EfficientNet + GRU

**Strengths:**

- Efficiency: EfficientNet is designed to be both accurate and efficient, providing good performance with lower computational cost.
- Caption Generation: GRUs (Gated Recurrent Units) are simpler and faster alternatives to LSTMs for sequence generation.

**Weaknesses:**
Real-time Performance: While efficient, it might not match YOLOv8's real-time object detection capabilities.
