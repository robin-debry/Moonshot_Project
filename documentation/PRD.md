## Overview

Today, not all images are optimised for screen readers because they depend on the creation of the site. So I decided to improve their functionality by giving priority to reading the text in the images.

## Opportunity statement

The issue lies in the inadequate adaptation of websites for visually impaired or blind individuals, even with the aid of screen readers. The development of these screen readers is crucial for facilitating easy and accessible use by such individuals. Given the vast scope of web accessibility, attention has been narrowed down to improving the reading of text embedded in images.
