## Overview

Nowadays, screen readers may not provide optimal accessibility for all images, as they are reliant on the website's structure. Therefore, my solution is to enhance their capabilities by prioritising the reading of image text.

## Opportunity statement

The issue lies in the inadequate adaptation of websites for visually impaired or blind individuals, even with the aid of screen readers. The development of these screen readers is crucial for facilitating easy and accessible use by such individuals. Given the vast scope of web accessibility, attention has been narrowed down to improving the reading of text embedded in images.

## Audience

These enhancements will greatly assist individuals with partial sight or blindness as they presently encounter significant difficulties with Internet usage, compared to their sighted counterparts.

## What will happen

Nowadays, screen readers are capable of reading some images in audio format, but only if the website conforms perfectly to the required web structure that permits this, by including "alt" tags containing written descriptions.The problem is that imprecise information can be provided in these descriptions, and very few "alt" tags are used at all. As a result, in the future, it would be preferable for screen readers to recognise text directly on the image, enabling automatic reading by the device, instead of relying on "alt" tags.

## Success criteria

Once the project is operational, it will undergo testing and usage by visually impaired and blind individuals to determine its effectiveness. Additionally, it will be essential to identify any discrepancies the system may encounter as it is impractical to evaluate all potential scenarios independently. Thus, allowing genuine users to ascertain the system's capabilities as per their usage would be optimal.

## Sizing

The investment will require more time, as I have not yet identified any potential economic costs associated with this project.
